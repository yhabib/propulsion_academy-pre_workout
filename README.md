1. HTML&CSS: Google look replica 
2. JavaScript:
    - Basics 
        * Pure functions
        * Tests with Mocha&Chai
    - OOP
        * Tests with Mocha&Chai
        * To test it -> cd JS and npm test
3. Java:
    - JUnit tests for all exercises
    - Food for thought:
        1. System.err makes sense to be used when an error is going to be displayed
        2. Without being to technical and avoiding to check O notation, I would choose a recursive, iterative or funcitonal solution if the code is cleaner and easier to read.
